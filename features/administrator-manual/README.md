This help section is for admins of Discover - it details how to maintain the lists of audiences, topics, and places.

## Getting started

Create a place or two first, then create a topic and add the places to that topic. Once that's done, create an audience and add that topic to it. You should then be able to click 'view main site' on the left to see the results.

Click on the manual sections on the left for more information about how to create audiences, topics and places.
